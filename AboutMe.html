        <h2>From Flying to Falling</h2>
        I wrote this because I love skiing and am excited to ski this year.
         <p>There once was a skier named Bob</p>
         <p>He skied like it was a fun job</p>
         <p>He tried to go off a jump</p>
         <p>He landed with a thump</p>
         <p>And now all he does is sob</p>

         <!--Brief Essay-->
         <h2>My personal interests</h2>
         <p>    I am currently attending UVU to get a degree in computer science because I want to create <a href = "https://github.com/smileysmith82/myproject" target="_blank">games</a>. 
            This is something that I love to do because I love to see how everything starts working together and it is fun to see the ripples of little changes.
        I also love that games can be a creative outlet for a lot of other hobbies including coding, writing and drawing. 
        </p>

        <p> Another one of my hobbies is writing. I currently am writing a book that I have been working on since high school. 
            I have had to stop working on it a few times, but I am always excited when I get to work on it.
        </p>

        <p> I also love spending time with my family; especially my wife and my cat. My wife and I have been married for just over a year and a half.
            When spending time with family, I love playing games, making food and watching movies. 
        </p>
